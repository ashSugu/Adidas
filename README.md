In this analysis, I explored the Adidas US product dataset from Kaggle to uncover review patterns across different products. A key insight emerged: distinct product variants (such as different colors of the same shoe) shared identical review counts and ratings. While initially this seemed like a dataset quirk, further investigation on Adidasâ€™ own website revealed the same pattern reviews were aggregated across all color variants of a product.

This has important implications. Aggregating reviews at the product level may simplify backend systems, but it also risks masking real customer sentiment. For example, if one color variant consistently underperforms in quality or appeal, that signal may be lost entirely. This could mislead both customers and internal teams, affecting decisions in design, marketing, and inventory management.

This analysis suggests that brands like Adidas could benefit from tracking and analyzing reviews at the variant level. A small structural change in their data pipeline could unlock more precise insights, enabling better alignment with customer preferences and improved product strategy.
